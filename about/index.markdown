Hi, my name is Andrew. I have been making websites and applications for 15 years. I've collected a broad set of programming (and some design) skills throughout that time. More so than I know what to do with.

These days I tend to focus on:

- [PHP](http://php.net) (with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/))
- API Design
- [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript)
- SQL Schema Design
- CRUD-style applications
- REST-like resources
- CSS/[jQuery](http://jquery.com/) experiments
- [OOCSS](http://bem.info/articles/yandex-frontend-dev/)
- [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org)
- SVG

I created this site in an attempt to share my knowledge, experience, and findings with others. I hope it helps you.

##What Motivates Me?

My main drive is to take complexity out of software. I love the feeling of taking an advanced API and simplifying down to the bare essentials. I live for the challenge of taking something complex and making it simple.

Software by it's very nature is complex, but there are ways to mitigate this complexity. Too often we try to improve our software by tacking more features on when really should be doing the opposite. By striving for simplicity we can create software that is modular, meaningful, and accessible.

##Other Stuff
